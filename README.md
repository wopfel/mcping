# mcping
Ping multiple hosts, curses interface

## Motivation
I was missing an MTR-like program, having multiple hosts in a nice UI and pinging them in a loop. There is / was mping, but I didn't find it in my favorite Linux distribution nor a source-code. So I was thinking about a program using Curses (NCurses?) with Perl.

## Required Perl packages
* Curses
* Time::HiRes
* Net::Ping

## Usage
This requires root privileges.
